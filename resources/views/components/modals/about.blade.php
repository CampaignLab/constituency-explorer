        <p>Constituency Explorer is an exploratory project between Campaign Lab and C6 Digital.</p>

        <p>We believe that it can help people run better local campaigns, by using local data.</p>

        <p>We have started with the data sets that we think are useful / easy to obtain and are currently in consultation with friends & colleagues to get their feedback.  If you have any feedback please let us know by emailing me (Jack): <a href="mailto:jack@c6digital.io" target="_blank">jack@c6digital.io</a></p>

        <p>The data has been mapped to the new constituencies using various resources:</p>

        <ul class="space-y-2.5 list-disc pl-4">
            <li><a href="https://postcodes.io/" target="_blank" class="underline font-medium">postcodes.io</a>: API service that returns geo data for a postcode</li>
            <li><a href="https://mapped.commonknowledge.coop/" target="_blank" class="underline font-medium">Mapped by Common Knowledge</a>: A great tool for uploading your postcodes and bulk returning data from postcodes.io</li>
            <li><a href="https://pages.mysociety.org/2025-constituencies/postcode-converter" target="_blank" class="underline font-medium">MySociety converter</a>: Another great tool for uploading postcodes and bulk converting data using local data source (very fast!)</li>
